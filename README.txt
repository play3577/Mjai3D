3D GUI client for mjai.
Version: 0.0.1

You can connect to a mjai server and play majong.

Currently, core features are almost implemented and other features aren't.

For example, we can change DEBUG only by editing "Program.cs".(when DEBUG is true, input is ../input3.txt. when DEBUG is false, input is TCP Socket. see "Program.cs".)

That is the same with the Socket destination.(you may think this is fatal...)
